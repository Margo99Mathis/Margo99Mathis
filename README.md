## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a data engineer with a strong focus on building and maintaining robust data pipelines using Python, SQL, and Apache Airflow. My goal is to streamline data workflows and ensure that data is processed, cleaned, and transformed efficiently, empowering teams to make data-driven decisions with reliable and accessible information.

Python is at the core of most of my projects, as it offers flexibility and scalability for data manipulation, transformation, and integration with various data sources. I leverage popular Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and PySpark to process large datasets and automate complex tasks. SQL is essential for querying, aggregating, and transforming data within relational databases, and I take pride in optimizing queries to ensure high performance and scalability.

Apache Airflow plays a critical role in orchestrating my data pipelines. I use it to design, schedule, and monitor workflows that move data seamlessly from one system to another. Whether itâ€™s data extraction from APIs, loading data into data warehouses, or running batch processing jobs, Airflow helps me keep track of dependencies, retries, and job failures, ensuring that the pipeline runs smoothly and reliably.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find examples of end-to-end data pipeline projects, including automated ETL workflows, real-time data processing, and integration with various cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. My goal is to create efficient, reusable, and maintainable pipelines that can scale as data grows and requirements evolve.

If you're working on similar projects or looking to collaborate, feel free to explore the code, open issues, or share feedback. Letâ€™s work together to improve the way we handle and process data.
